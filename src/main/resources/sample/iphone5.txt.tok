After just a week on the market , the iPhone 5 has owners writing up a laundry list of faults with the new device .
Soon after the iPhone 5 went on sale last Friday , users started filling up discussion forums and social networks with reports of scratches and nicks on their brand - new phones .
People say they 've noticed the defects around the aluminum band surrounding the phone , with the issue more visible on the black version of the new iPhone .
Those complaints do n't appear to bother Apple .
" Any aluminum product may scratch or chip with use , exposing its natural silver color , " Apple Senior Marketing VP Phil Schiller said in an e-mail , according to 9to5Mac , " That is normal . "
Apple seems much more taken aback by the flap over its iOS 6 Maps app -- so much so that CEO Tim Cook on Friday took the startling step , for Apple , of issuing a major mea culpa for falling short of delivering the best possible experience .
" We are extremely sorry , " Cook wrote , " for the frustration this has caused our customers and we are doing everything we can to make Maps better . "
